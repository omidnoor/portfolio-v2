        Hi, I'm Omid! As an aspiring front-end developer with a unique
        background in engineering and neuroscience, I have a strong drive to
        create intuitive and engaging web experiences. I began by learning the
        fundamentals of HTML and CSS and then built upon that foundation with
        advanced CSS and SCSS techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        ve also dedicated over ... hours to mastering JavaScript, React, NextJS,
        CSS/SCSS/HTML and have a strong understanding of advanced topics. My
        expertise lies in the React and Next.js ecosystems, where I've completed
        several comprehensive courses to enhance my skills. Some of the key
        projects I've worked on include [briefly mention the 3 projects here,
        e.g., a fully-featured e-commerce platform, an Instagram page clone, and
        an AI-powered blog application]. You can find more details about these
        projects in the [Projects] section of my portfolio.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my web development skills, I hold bachelor's and master's
        degrees in Mechanical Engineering and an additional master's degree in
        Neuroscience. My diverse academic background has equipped me with strong
        problem-solving and analytical skills, which I've applied to various
        data analysis projects using Python, 3D modeling, and electromechanical
        tool development during my studies. These skills have been invaluable in
        my transition to web development, as they have allowed me to tackle
        complex projects and develop innovative solutions. As I continue to
        build my portfolio, I plan to expand my skillset by working on even more
        diverse and challenging projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        My unique background, coupled with my dedication to learning and
        hands-on experience with real-world projects, make me an ideal candidate
        for entry-level front-end developer roles. I am confident that my
        passion for creating captivating web experiences, combined with my
        technical expertise, will contribute to the success of any team I join.
